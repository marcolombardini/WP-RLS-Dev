XML feed templates (Naked) with annotations on required nodes

If your developing a theme to use with wpREAP you will need to have those requried nodes in your listing template.    
The easiet to use would be Zillow, Trulia, and HotPads, since they have the most common requirements, also it won't bloat users with options and you with many fields.
